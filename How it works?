  assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22) #create number vector
  myMean <- function(assignment2){return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))} # define a function
  myMean(assignment2)# call the function 
  
# analyze the process and result.
  # First create a number vector and name it assignment2. Next, define a function and name
  # it myMean. It will take the argument, calculate its sum, and divide the sum by the length.
  # Call the function to print the result.
